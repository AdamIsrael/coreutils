# wc

A Rust implementation of the stalwart GNU [coreutils](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils) utility `wc`.

This is a proof-of-concept. I'm using this as a learning exercise and is not intended as a replacement for `wc`.

The intent of the project was feature parity, which has now been achieved.
